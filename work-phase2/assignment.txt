prescribe0: returns all levels to 0 (dance) all days
prescribe1: LSTM model 1
prescribe2: greedy algorithm with a loss function using 10*pop/100,000
prescribe3: returns maximum levels for 45 days (hammer) and then all levels to 0 (dance)
prescribe4: returns all maximum levels (hammer) all days
prescribe5: returns the plan with smallest daily ratio (from ratios.csv) for 45 days and then all levels to 0 (dance)
